# Cement-Floor-Tear-Detection
This repository contains the code for training and deploying a deep learning model to detect torn cement floors. The model is designed to classify images as either "Torn" or "Non-Torn" cement floors, making it a valuable tool for quality control and maintenance in industrial and construction settings.

This project focuses on using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to perform image classification for torn and non-torn cement floors. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient solution for identifying damaged areas, enabling timely maintenance and repairs.
